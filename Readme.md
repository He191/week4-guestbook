I did Project planning with help of Trello Board.

I created Wireframe design in ok!so. I designed two wireframes - one for Desktop screen and One for mobile screen.

I divided the project in 2 parts 
1. Database --> Server --> Client = Get data from database using db query into the server using get routes. I tested the results on server page and then connected client with server via a Fetch request. Again tested the database data first in client console and then updated the client code to show it on HTML.
2. Client --> Server --> Database = Created a form for user to input the data about feedback. Verified the feedback on client console and then passed it onto Server using Fetch. Once again verified the data on server console and then inserted the same to database using db query insert SQL query.
